    <title>Inline and Block elements</title>
</head>
<body>
     The Block element means that it will take the full width of a single line and does not allow any other content to fit in it. 
     <br>
     Inline elements are those elements which only occupy the space bounded by the tags defining the element, instead of breaking the flow of element. On the other hand, block-level elements take up the entire space of its parent element.
