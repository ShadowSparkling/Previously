    <h3>Ids and classes in HTML</h3><br>
    <strong>The ID is an identifier which must be unique in the whole HTML document. It is used to find an element while linking, scripting, or styling. Whereas, Classes allow CSS and JavaScript to select and access specific elements.</strong><br>
    <em>When a new child is born, we urge to give him a name or his identity by which he will be known further. Or if you are having a pet, you must have given him some name to call. In the same way, IDs refer to giving a name to any particular element for its identity. It simply refers giving an identity to an element. We know, no two names can be given to any of the two members of the family. In the same way, one ID can be given to only one element on a website. </em><br>
